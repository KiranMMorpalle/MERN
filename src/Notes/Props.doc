Sure! Let's break down React Props in a simple and practical way 👇

✅ What Are Props in React?
Props (short for Properties) are a way to pass data from one component to another in React — usually from a parent to a child component.
They are read-only, meaning the child cannot modify the props it receives.

📦 Think of it like:
You're giving a gift (prop) to a friend (component). They can use it, but they can't change it.

🧠 Key Concepts
FeatureDescription🔁 One-way Data FlowProps flow from parent ➡️ child (not both ways)🔒 ImmutableProps cannot be changed by the receiving component⚙️ CustomizableComponents become dynamic using props💡 Pure FunctionsComponents use props to return UI based on input
🧪 Example
🧩 Parent Component
import React from 'react';
import Greet from './Greet';
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greet name="Kiran" age={24} />
      <Greet name="Asha" age={21} />
    </div>
  );}

🧩 Child Component
function Greet({ name, age }) {
  return (
    <h2>Hello {name}, you are {age} years old!</h2>
  );
}

export default Greet;

🖥️ Output:
Hello Kiran, you are 24 years old!
Hello Asha, you are 21 years old!

🔐 Props Are Read-Only
props.name = "Rahul"; // ❌ This will give an error

✅ Why Use Props?
• 🔁 Reusability: Same component, different data
• ⚙️ Dynamic UI: Change output based on input
• 📤 Communication: Parent → Child data flow

🧠 Advanced Props (Optional)
• Pass functions as props
• Props with arrays/objects
• Props.children (for nested components)
